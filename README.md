## nn-cpp
Basically all machine learning I've done has been with Python using PyTorch, Sk-Learn, TF, etc. and I'm curious to see, if I get anywhere even close to the performance of a simple MLP with pure C++ in comparison to say PyTorch (probably not but we'll see).

# NOTE!
**This project is pretty much in its initial stages and I'm working on it whenever I have time. I'm also quite new to C++ so beware of bad code!**
