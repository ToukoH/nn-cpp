# NOTE!
**This project is pretty much in its initial stages and I'm working on it whenever I have time. I'm new to C++ so beware of bad code!**

I'd say I'm pretty comfortable with Python and some of it's external Machine Learning/Deep Learning libraries. I'm curious to see, if I get anywhere even close to the performance of a simple MLP with pure C++ in comparison to say PyTorch (probably not but we'll see).
